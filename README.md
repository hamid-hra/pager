This module was written by Hamid Reza Attari in PHP language.

Its use is to play the sound in a speaker through a VoIP phone.

Example: In the hospital, a group needs to go to the emergency department by dialing the code 99. Now, by hitting the number 99 on a Vise, it will be played in the bellgos of the hospital.
